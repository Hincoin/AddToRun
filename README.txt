This program allows you to make shortcuts for Windows applications in the run prompt.  For example, configuring the characters 'ch' to represent 'chrome' or 'ie' to represent iexplore, will come in handy for the lazy typer!

To use, either compile the source or run the .exe that's already built ( Requires Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable or later). You will be presented with a command line utility prompting you for the shortcut name ("ch", "ie", "py", "note"), etc. Hit enter.

Following this, you will be prompted to input the location of the executable (you can and should enable edit-mode by right clicking on the command prompt window so you can paste in long directory paths). Remove any quotation marks should they be present in the directory path (sometimes copying and pasting in Windows leaves you with some quotation marks).

Hit enter and you should see a successfull "Done!" message. Now, you can Windows+R (or however you used to get to the run prompt), and type in the new command shortcut you created in the 1st step!

Enjoy!!
